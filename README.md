# reimann-hypothesis-neural-network
This repository uses an MLPRegression neural network to predict the non-trivial zeroes of the Reimann Zeta Function: the subject of a $1 million prize! 
The first file (regression.py) tests out the neural network in predicting the prime numbers. 
The second file (reimann_zeta_regression.py) tests it out in predicting the zeros of the zeta function. The file (100000zeroes.txt) contains the imaginary parts of the first 100000 non-trivial zeroes of the zeta function. This is used as training and testing data for the neural network.
